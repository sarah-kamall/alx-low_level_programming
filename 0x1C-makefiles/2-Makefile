CC = gcc 
SRC =  main.c school.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
Name = school

all :
	$(CC) $(SRC) -o $(Name)

To compile only the updated source files in a Makefile, you can take advantage of Make's built-in features to track dependencies and only rebuild files when their dependencies have changed.

Here's a basic example of how you can achieve this:

make
Copy code
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra

SRCS = main.c utils.c
OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)
EXECUTABLE = program

all: $(EXECUTABLE)

$(EXECUTABLE): $(OBJS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^

%.o: %.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
